title: Where do bikes take us together? 
---

Back in December, the [Hubway Data Challenge](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/) released data on Boston's Hubway bikeshare and asked people to do interesting stuff with it. The winning entries explored [how much time Hubway saved](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/submission/45/) Bostonians, [how bikes flowed through](http://zsobhani.github.com/hubway-team-viz) the Hubway system, and [how Boston's relationship](http://hubwaydatachallenge.org/submission/56/) with Hubway evolved over half a million trips. 

I wanted to ask a different question: how often do people go places together, where do they go, and do these trips differ from the rest of Hubway uses? 

Identifying group trips is made a bit difficult by the lack of individual identifiers in the data. Instead, we have to make the assumption that two trips that both leave from the same station at the same time, and arrive at the same station at the same time, were taken together. 

With that assumption, 61,430 trips of the 552,030 trips in the dataset were taken together. In those trips:

1. People traveling together tend to be younger
2. They were more likely to travel on the weekends
3. They tended to leave later, even on weekdays
4. They rode more slowly
5. They were closer in age
6. They are more likely to go have fun: The Arlington / Boyleston station, near Boston Public Garden, was the top destination for those traveling togther. Solo travelers were more likely bound for the South Station Transit Hub.
