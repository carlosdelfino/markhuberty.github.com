<h3>Welcome </h3>

<p>
  Welcome to the home page for Mark
  Huberty. I'm a graduate student in the
  <a href="http://polisci.berkeley.edu" >Travers Department of Political Science</a> at
  <a href="http://berkeley.edu" >UC Berkeley</a>, and a Research Associate at the
  <a href="http://brie.berkeley.edu" >Berkeley Roundtable on the International
    Economy</a>. 
</p>
<p>My political science research spans
  three somewhat distinct areas: climate
  change and the politics of energy systems
  transformations; technological change and
  political contestation; and statistical and
  computational methods. You can find more on
  my research, as well as working papers, at
  <a href="/publications.html">my research page</a>.
