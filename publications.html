<h2 class="title">Research overview </h2>
<p>
  My research focuses on three inter-related problems in political economy:
  
  <ul>
    <li>The political economy of climate and
      energy policy</li>
    <li>The political economy of innovation and change in advanced
      industrial societies</li>
    <li>Potential applications of machine learning and computational methods in these areas</li>
  </ul>

<h3 class="title">Dissertation</h3>
<p>
  My dissertation analyzes the political economy of climate change
  mitigation, with an emphasis on the dynamics of a low-emissions energy
  systems transformation. I demonstrate that serious emissions reduction requires the transformation, rather than modification, of modern energy systems. Building on that, I show that energy systems transformation has a unique logic that compounds the difficulty of long-term emissions reduction when pursued in isolation. 
</p>
<p>
  But I also suggest that the technical and economic structure of the energy system may permit patterns of issue linkage that enable policymakers to connect long-term emissions reduction to shorter-term policy goals that deliver immediate and tangible benefits in domains like energy security or competitiveness. Those
  benefits can help insulate policy from political resistance by losers
  from climate change mitigation, and generate new interests supportive
  of policy continuity. I argue that this pattern will mean that
  successful climate policy will come to look more like industrial policy than
  environmental policy; will include emissions pricing as only one of a multitude of policy instruments;  and will be as nationally idiosyncratic as the
  energy systems that it must transform.
