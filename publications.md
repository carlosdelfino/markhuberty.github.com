Research overview
-----------------

My research focuses on three inter-related problems in political
economy:

-   The political economy of climate and energy policy
-   The political economy of innovation and change in advanced
    industrial societies
-   Potential applications of machine learning and computational methods
    in these areas

### Dissertation

My dissertation analyzes the political economy of climate change
mitigation, with an emphasis on the dynamics of a low-emissions energy
systems transformation. I demonstrate that serious emissions reduction
requires the transformation, rather than modification, of modern energy
systems. Building on that, I show that energy systems transformation has
a unique logic that compounds the difficulty of long-term emissions
reduction when pursued in isolation.

But I also suggest that the technical and economic structure of the
energy system may permit patterns of issue linkage that enable
policymakers to connect long-term emissions reduction to shorter-term
policy goals that deliver immediate and tangible benefits in domains
like energy security or competitiveness. Those benefits can help
insulate policy from political resistance by losers from climate change
mitigation, and generate new interests supportive of policy continuity.
I argue that this pattern will mean that successful climate policy will
come to look more like industrial policy than environmental policy; will
include emissions pricing as only one of a multitude of policy
instruments; and will be as nationally idiosyncratic as the energy
systems that it must transform.
