<h4>Colophon</h4>
The design of this website is based on the <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/">Blueprint CSS framework</a> and  inherited a lot from that of <a href="http://www.kieranhealy.org">Prof. Kieran Healy</a>. He also deserves thanks for his excellent discussion of software tools for social scientists, and for his Emacs starter kit.
